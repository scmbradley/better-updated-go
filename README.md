# B.U.G.: Better, Updated Go. Version 0.1.1

This is an extremely dumb idea I have decided to implement as part of 
[Github's 2021 Game Off](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021) event.
You play Go/Igo/Baduk/Weiqi, but there's some randomness about where your stone gets placed.
Also, there are powerups.
Currently, the powerups aren't implemented, and probably won't be before the end of the game jam.

You also have to score the game yourself, because that's hard to implement!
